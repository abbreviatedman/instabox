# Instabox - A Subsidiary of Flexbook


### Introduction

Today we'll be making Instagram.

Well, not the functionality... but the layout, at least!

Well, no, not the _whole_ layout, of course... but the layout of a profile page, anyway.

Well, okay, not the layout of even one profile page. But the top of one.

It's still gonna be hard!

But it'll be a lot easier with Flexbox.


### Your Assignment

You'll be working in pairs (using our new GitHub collaboration tools!) and replicating this website:

### Requirements

* You may _not_ use any layout tools besides flexbox. You can use `margin` and `padding` I GUESS, but only if you're using it to make it look a little prettier, _not_ to solve a problem like, say, spacing between the category photo circles at the bottom.
* You _must_ switch with your partner every once in a while. It's up to you how long, but push up, switch drivers, and pull down whenever you've finished a task.

#### Some Resources

* The [codepen](#) we did together.
* CSS Tricks' excellent [run-through](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) of Flexbox.
