# Instabox - A Subsidiary of Flexbook


### Introduction

Today we'll be making Instagram.

Well, not the functionality... but the layout, at least!

Well, no, not the _whole_ layout, of course... but the layout of a profile page, anyway.

Well, okay, not the layout of even one profile page. But the top of one.

It's still gonna be hard!

But it'll be a lot easier with Flexbox.


### Your Assignment

You'll be working in pairs (using our new GitHub collaboration tools!) and replicating this website:
